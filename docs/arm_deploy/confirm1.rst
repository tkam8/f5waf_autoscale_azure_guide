.. NOTE:: In order to confirm the results of REST API calls made in this lab, it's 
   recommended to keep GUI/SSH sessions to BIG-IP and iWorkflow devices open. 
   By default, BIG-IP and iWorkflow will log all the REST API related events locally 
   to **restjavad.0.log** . These logs can also be directed to a remote syslog server 
   (see https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13080). On a side note, the **ltm** 
   log files listed below contains log messages specific to  BIG-IP local 
   traffic management events.
